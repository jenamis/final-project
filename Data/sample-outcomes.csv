Precipitate caused pipetting motor fault which caused system to abort (initial error messages allowed ""Ignore"" only; led to ""Abort"" as only option; method would not continue.
Recover of COI from cartridge done offline: 
1)~2mL of DCM, followed by ~5mL Methanol added to column headspace containing precipitated solution.  Sample gently stirred with glass pipette to mix.  
2) The top of cart was sealed with rubber septa and using Nitrogen gas @~1-2psi, the septa was pierced with needle supplying gas and eluent was collected into D2 vial. 
3) Due to liquid-liquid separation of organic and aqueous layers in the eluent vial, the aqueous layer was hand pipetted out of vial to obtain and aqueous fraction and organic fraction.  Aqueous layer was white, cloudy suspension ~2mL; Organic layer was yellow, transparent, ~2mL
4) 5uL aliquots of each layer was added to 35uL of methanol in HPLC vials.  Samples submitted to SAP5 for LCMS alysis and COI location determition. 
5) D2 vials with separated fractions placed under positive pressure nitrogen evaporation station in hood offline"
