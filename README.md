## Team Communication Protocol
The project team will use the following protocol for communicating about the project: 
- A dedicated Slack channel that includes only team members will be used as the primary method for communication about the project.
- Slack messages directed at a specific team member or members will include a mention for the team member(s).
- All team members will have Slack notifications for the channel turned on so they will be alerted to new project messages. 
- All team members will be expected to respond to Slack messages within 24 hours. If no response is received within 24 hours, communication will be re-sent via text message. 
- Team meetings will be conducted via Google Meet on an as needed basis. The date and time of the next meeting will be determined at the end of each meeting.
