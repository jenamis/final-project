# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PostgreSQL is the database we intend to use to store our working data. 

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn and ImbalancedLearn are the ML libraries we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is 75% training, while 25% is used for testing. Using our dataset, we will be using Logistic Regression with: 
* Oversampling: Random OverSampling algorithm and SMOTE algorithm
* Undersampling: Cluster Centroids algorithm 
* Combination (Over and Undersampling): SMOOTEEN algorithm 
* Ensemble algorithms: Balanced Random Forest classifiers and Easy Ensemble AdaBoost classifier

## Dashboard
In addition to using HTML/CSS and Javascript, we will integrate D3.js for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard.
